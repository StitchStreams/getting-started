## THE OFFICIAL (AND UNOFFICIAL) COLLECTION OF TAPS

### Defining Official and Unofficial

Singer supports official Taps through [Stitch](https://stitchdata.com). Stitch is software that moves all your data into your datawarehouse and keeps everything nice and tidy. Official taps are maintained and integrated by the team at Stitch. This is why not all unofficial taps become official. Sometimes the team is building something else and other times the integration isn't high on the roadmap priorities. 

Regardless this doesn't mean that you can't move all the data you want. Which is why unofficial taps are so important and why we value them so much! If you've created a tap or target be sure to simply submit a pull request to our unofficial table and show the world your work. Also be sure to drop us a line so we can send you *EPIC SWAG* üéÅ

Without further ado here are the unofficial taps:
