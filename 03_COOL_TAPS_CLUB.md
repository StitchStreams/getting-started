## THE OFFICIAL (AND UNOFFICIAL) COLLECTION OF TAPS

### Defining Official and Unofficial

To make a tap or target official the Singer team has reviewed the work and it conforms to the best practices. Official means stamp of review & approval. It also means the repo is put into the Singer github organizaiton. For transparency the Singer team is comprised of Stitch employees. [Stitch](https://stitchdata.com)

Regardless of being official or unofficial you can still move or pull all the data you want. *This is why unofficial taps are so important and why we value them so much!* 

### If you've created a tap or target be sure to simply submit a pull request to our unofficial table and show the world your work. 
Also be sure to drop us a line so we can send you *EPIC SWAG* üéÅ

Without further ado here are the unofficial taps:
