#🎉👋🏽 Welcome to Singer: Open-source ETL 🎉👋🏽


Singer is an open source ETL tool. In case you're unfamiliar ETL stands for Extract, Transform, and Load. It's a term used in the data warehousing world. If you happen to be moving data or needing to pull data we want to help!

###Singer sets a standard for moving data between databases, web APIs, files, queues, or just about anything else you can think of. _(Except penguins 🐧 and candy 🍬. We haven't figured out how to move those yet unfortunately.)_

In this documentation we'll take you through a number of scenarios. 

- 🍺 If you'd like to pull or extract data check out [TAPS](02_EXTRACT_WITH_TAPS.md)
- 🎯 If you'd like to send or load data check out [TARGETS](03_LOAD_WITH_TARGETS.md)
- 📝 If you want to dive in some technical goodness check out our [SPECS](07_SPEC.md)
- 😎✅ Once you've created your own tap or target be sure to let us know and join our kool kids [UNOFFICIAL](04_COOL_UNOFFICIAL_CLUB.md) club or learn how to submit to be part of the super cool [OFFICIAL](05_MAKE_IT_OFFICIAL.md) integrations.
- 💯 Check this out to learn more about [BEST PRACTICES](06_BEST_PRACTICES.md)
- 🤝 And above all please respect our [CODE OF CONDUCT](09_CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
